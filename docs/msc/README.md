Mscgen sequence diagrams
========================

This contains the message sequence diagrams for the various Voucher Operations (Issue / Cancel / Transfer / Redeem) for entities participating in the Voucher Transaction System (VTS) as decribed in the RFC3506 and the TLA+ specifications that we built around it.

How to build
------------

Information on building and installing [Mscgen](http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/) can
be found [here](https://github.com/Oliviers-OSS/mscgen). A web based implementation can
be seen [here](https://mscgen.js.org/)).

Once you have Mscgen installed doing a `make` should generate the images.

DOT diagrams
============

This contains the state diagram for a Voucher participating in the Voucher Transaction System (VTS) as decribed in the RFC3506 and the TLA+ specifications that we built around it.

How to build
------------

Information on building and installing [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) can
be found [here](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) ([more

Once you have Graphviz installed doing a `make` should generate the images.

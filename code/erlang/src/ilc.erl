%%% This module implements the State Machine defined in the "Issuer
%%% Life Cycle" TLA+ specification. A diagram of the states and the
%%% transition rules can be found in the DOT specification.
%%%
%%% This Finite State Machine (FSM) is private to the entity who is
%%% involved in a Voucher operation. So the VTP has no visibility of the
%%% the current state of the Entity involved in the Voucher operaton.
%%%
%%% The FSM exclusively tracks the state of the Entity. No other
%%% information is tracked or passed here. Given the "current" state,
%%% and the operation being performed, the FSM accurately gives the
%%% the next state.

%% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
%% Initialize the FSM to a known state for the entity.
%%
%% If an entity's state is not yet defined, you pass in "initialize" as
%% the state to initialize the entity to the starting state
%%
%% The spawned process can then be used to perform transitions in the
%% state machine.
